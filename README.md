# (Group 04) File Organiser Utility Project.

We will build a File Organizer Utility that scans a user-selected folder, groups files into categories based on file extensions,
shows a preview of proposed moves in a confirmation GUI, performs the moves on confirmation, and supports undoing the last operation. Weâ€™ll use Python 3.10, pipenv for dependency management, pytest for tests, and Tkinter for a minimal GUI. Developer(s) will implement scanning, preview, move, and undo; QA will write two pytest tests (propose moves, undo). Docs/Presenter will prepare README, demo video, and final report.

## Features  
- Organizes files into folders by file extension.  
- Command-line interface (CLI) for quick use.  
- Graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter.  
- Automated tests using Pytest.

## Tests
Run the CLI:
pipenv run python src/main.py

Run the GUI:
pipenv run python src/gui.py

Run the test suite with:
pipenv run pytest
